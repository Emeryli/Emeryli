## 👋 Hi there!

💻 I like coding in 🌐 JavaScript, ☕ Java and 🐍 Python!
   
🔨 I'm currently working on sentiment analysis that is used in trading machine learning, built using lumibot and Python
   
✨ In the past, I've worked on [Academic Prediction](https://github.com/Emeryli/MachineLearningProject) and [User Authentication](https://github.com/Emeryli/WebApplication).
  
Feel free to reach out!
